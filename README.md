Collects scripts for processing texts for the C19 French Newspapers Scandal project at W&L.

Primary script for text analysis is main.py.

To begin, clone the repository and change into it.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:wludh/frenchnewspapers.git
$ cd frenchnewspapers
```

The scripts are written in python 3. First install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if you haven't already. Then use homebrew to stall python3
```bash
$ brew install python3
```
Then install dependencies using pip.
